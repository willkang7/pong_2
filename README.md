# Pong 2
Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It was invented in 1972
by Allan Alcorn and has received zero updates since its release. But no
worries! Here's a twist on the classic game.

## Installation
This project uses Python 3.

## Usage
The game goes up to five points. Each round, a player can use
up to three specials. The ball speeds up after each hit.

Player A | Player B | Action
------------ | ------------- | -------------
w | up | Move paddle up
s | down | Move paddle down
r | , | Long paddle
t | . | Fastball
